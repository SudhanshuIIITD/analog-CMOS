The Strong Arm Sense Amplifier (SASA) is a type of sense amplifier used in SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) to sense and amplify the voltage difference between two memory cells during read operations. The SASA is a popular sense amplifier architecture used in high-performance SRAMs due to its speed, low power consumption, and noise tolerance.

The SASA works by comparing the voltage levels of two inputs, typically the bit-line and a reference voltage, and amplifying the voltage difference between them. The SASA employs a differential amplifier with two input transistors that are biased in a way that ensures a balanced output voltage. This balance helps in reducing the sensitivity of the SASA to noise.

The SASA is called a "Strong Arm" amplifier because of its ability to produce a strong output signal, even when the input signal is weak. It uses a feedback loop to regenerate and amplify the output signal, which results in a high gain, making it less sensitive to noise and improving its robustness.

Compared to other sense amplifier designs, such as the Cross-Coupled Sense Amplifier (CCSA), the SASA has a simpler design and consumes less power, making it ideal for high-density SRAMs used in mobile devices, which require low power consumption.

In summary, the Strong Arm Sense Amplifier (SASA) is a popular sense amplifier architecture used in high-performance SRAMs. It provides fast and accurate read operations, is less sensitive to noise, and consumes less power than other sense amplifier designs.
